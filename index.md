# Ransomware encrypting files...


## I mean seriously, you just scanned this random QR with no hesitation?
What did you think was going to happen? You thought you were going to get some free videogame or something?

Scanning random QR codes can be like playing Russian roulette with your phone, you never know what kind of crazy virus or malware you might end up downloading. It's like your phone getting kidnapped and held for ransom. Except instead of money, it's demanding you pay in Bitcoin and precious photos of your cat and your somewhat-concerning-but-not-enough-to-go-to-a-doctor skin rash are the hostages. So, unless you want to end up with a "Your Phone is Hacked" tattoo on your forehead, it's best to avoid scanning random QR codes. Instead, stick to the QR codes you trust, like the ones on your friend's homemade beer cans or your grandma's fruitcake recipe.
